# Embedded-Project
This project connects the Arduino Multi-Function Shield to the NUCLEO-F401RE board, using its 4-digit 7-segment display, buttons, and a potentiometer. The real-time clock (RTC) tracks elapsed time, displaying it on the shield. Pressing a button switches the display to show an analog voltage reading.
